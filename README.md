# User Registration Project

## Overview
This project is a user registration application with a frontend interface and backend CRUD operations. It allows users to view, add, update, and delete user information, which includes Name, Email, and Date of Birth.

## Repository Structure
- **frontend**: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.
- **backend**: Contains the backend API files for managing CRUD operations.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for running the backend)
- A modern web browser (for running the frontend)

---

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
To start, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kashishkedia/User-Registration-Project.git
```

## Running the Project

### Backend Setup
1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd User-Registration-Project/backend
   ```
2. **Install necessary packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. The backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. **Open `index.html`** in a web browser:
   - Double-click `index.html` in the frontend folder to open it in your default browser.
   - Alternatively, you can right-click the file and select "Open With" to choose a specific browser.

## API Endpoints
Here are the backend API endpoints that allow interaction with the user data:

- **GET** `/users`: Fetch all registered users.
- **POST** `/users`: Add a new user. Requires a JSON object with `name`, `email`, and `dob` fields.
- **PUT** `/users/:id`: Update an existing user by ID. Requires a JSON object with updated `name`, `email`, and `dob` fields.
- **DELETE** `/users/:id`: Delete a user by ID.

---

## Usage
1. **Adding a User**: Use the form in the frontend to enter a new userâ€™s information and click "Add User".
2. **Viewing Users**: Go to the "View Users" tab to see a list of registered users.
3. **Editing a User**: In the "View Users" tab, click "Edit" next to a user to modify their details inline, then click "Save".
4. **Deleting a User**: In the "View Users" tab, click "Delete" to remove a user from the list.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the backend server is running at `http://localhost:5000` for the frontend to connect successfully.
- Both frontend and backend must be running on the same machine or network.
